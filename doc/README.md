# Introduction to the API Landscape

Open-source Web API Management stack. Your APIs, totally organised.

API Landscape helps you know the exact price and risk of making changes in the API environment.

> It enables machines to resolve API Entrypoint URL from API Design Name in Local, CI/CD or Production Environment.

API Landscape framework is a set of simple [conventions](/conventions.md),  [building blocks](/components.md) and a [stack of integrated tools](/tooling.md) for:

* Cross-organizational collaboration on API Design
* API Dependency tracking and management
* API Design release management, change managment and upfront advertisement
* Server, Client, Design Lifecycle orchestration
* Contract-driven API server and client development and validation
* Service Environment Virtualization
* Design-time and Runtime API Discovery
* DevOps & Infrastructure automation
* Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery

API Landscape is:

* 100% implementation, platform and language agnostic
* 100% vendor independent, using open standard and formats
* 100% API Style unopinionated
* 100% decentralized

> API Landscape is safe and solid ground for Autonomous APIs and self-driving API Clients.
