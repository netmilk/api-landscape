# Introduction to the API Landscape

All the APIs, totally organised.

API Landscape is a suistainable, decentrlized and automated way of building, organizing and changing a massive amount of APIs and client-server integrations across multiple different teams and organizations. Undrestanding and visibility of the full picture of the API Lnadscape helps you to know the exact price and risk of making changes in the API environment.

> iIt enables machines to resolve API Entrypoint URL from API Design Name in Local, CI/CD or Production Environment.

API Landscape framework is a set of simple [building blocks](/components.md), [conventions](/conventions.md), and a [stack of integrated tools](/tooling.md) for:

* Cross-organizational contract-driven collaboration on API Design
* Contract-driven API server and client development and validation
* API Dependency tracking and management
* API Design release management, change managment and upfront advertisement
* API Server, API Client, API Design Lifecycle orchestration
* Service Environment Virtualization
* Design-time and Runtime API Discovery
* DevOps & Infrastructure automation
* Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery

API Landscape is:

* 100% decentralized
* 100% implementation, platform and language agnostic
* 100% vendor independent, using open standard and formats
* 100% API Style unopinionated

> API Landscape is the safe and solid ground for Autonomous APIs and self-driving API Clients.

API Landscape is for:

* API Client and Server Developers
* API Architects
* API Product Owners and Managers
